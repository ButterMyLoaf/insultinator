you have a face only a mother could love
were you dropped on your head when you were a child?
if i was in a room with you, hitler, and bin laden, i would shoot myself twice
you probably put water in your cereal
humanity was a mistake and you are the proof
you probably pour milk first
pouring bleach into my eyes would hurt less than looking at you
I thought everybody deserves love until I met you
